can send each vector one at a time

can send each list (vector) one at a time, then rebuild map 

for i = rank; i < size; i+=numProcessors
//divides problem into size of numprocessors, starts at unique spot according to rank, then increments by 
number of processors

each process return triad counts

sum them
